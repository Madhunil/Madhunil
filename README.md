👋 Hi, I’m @Madhunil

I’m skilled in Python, GoLang, Java, SQL, Shell script, Machine learning, Networking, Kubernetes, AWS Cloud Tools, Data Science, System Design, Distributed Systems, Git, Asana, and JIRA.

I have worked as a Senior Developer at Standard Chartered GBS for 3 years on projects related to data pipeline design & development, data analysis, and data modeling. Also have experienced the transition of the org from waterfall to agile environment.

I am a strong professional with a Master's degree focused in Data Science from Northeastern University Boston and a Bachelor's degree focused on Electronics and Communication from VIT University.

I like to face new challenges, understand businesses and solve real-time problems. Interested and ready to learn any new technology.
While pursuing my master's I also did a Data Science Coop at Danfoss Inc where my project focused on predicting delayed orders which resulted in customer satisfaction

Currently, I am working in Amazon AWS, for the EKS side of the Windows Container Technologies Team which comes under the EC2 Org.
Always willing to innovate new things which can improve the existing technology and system.

🌱 Some of my personal ongoing projects include Indo-European-language-family-analysis-using-NLP-techniques and some cloud computing, K8s and data related stuff at AWS.
